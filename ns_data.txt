great obvious bush administration produce one last year clinton administration first year rice said working report two way handle document told one kind minimalist way get view since going first one bush administration important awful lot happened since started process prior give certain date going would think sometime spring important real statement bush administration see strategic direction going seems clear already rice set forth hope dominant american role world might couple year ago question appear settled yet obviously asked much united state willing operate alone foreign affair much change willing try engender inside country end mean leak couple week ago new american nuclear posture adding offensive capability rogue state departed decade official adherence purely defensive position one indication scope reconsideration going united state position redrawing regional map especially middle east replacing government force nobody thought bush administration would thinking ambitious term plainly internal debate right month ago election republican foreign policy figure suggested good indication bush administration direction foreign affair would got higher ranking job paul wolfowitz richard haass haass another veteran first bush administration intellectual like wolfowitz much moderate published book titled reluctant sheriff poked little fun wolfowitz famous strategy briefing early ninety called pentagon paper disagreed idea united state try world great power long term better worse goal beyond reach haass wrote simply doable elsewhere book disagreed another wolfowitz team main idea united state expanding democratic zone peace primacy confused hegemony united state cannot compel others become democratic haass argued united state becoming le dominant world suggested revival might called traditional great power politics wolfowitz got higher ranking job haass deputy secretary defense haass director policy planning state department effect colin powell big think guy recently went see office state department wall waiting room array photograph every past director policy planning staff beginning george kennan father containment doctrine first holder office haass occupies another indication way thing moving washington haass seems become hawkish mentioned title book using word reluctant reflective period foreign policy seemed secondary sacrificing foreign policy hard case make said written bill clinton saying economy stupid world stupid two thing different one president much easier time making case foreign policy matter second top national security chart notion weapon mass destruction terrorism asked haass whether doctrine emerging broad kennan containment think said seeing administration emergence new principle body idea sure constitutes doctrine might call limit sovereignty sovereignty entail obligation one massacre people another support terrorism way government fails meet obligation forfeit normal advantage sovereignty including right left alone inside territory government including united state gain right intervene case terrorism even lead right preventive peremptory self defense essentially act anticipation ground think question going attacked clearly haass thinking iraq think american public need lot persuading evil saddam hussein said also fully expect president chief lieutenant make case public opinion changed able make case discretionary action one done self defense larger issue american role world haass still maintaining distance hawk made speech long called imperial america told big difference imperial imperialist think little bit careful said great advantage still limit ally impose idea everyone want fighting war alone need others join u american leadership yes american unilateralism multilateral win war terror alone send force everywhere really collaborative endeavor stopped moment successor idea containment think said idea integration goal foreign policy persuade major power sign certain key idea world operate opposition terrorism weapon mass destruction support free trade democracy market integration locking policy building institution lock even first mean last obvious manifestation new american foreign policy effort remove saddam hussein united state iraq operation likely dwarf done far afghanistan term scale operation term aftermath several week ago ahmad chalabi head iraqi national congress iraqi opposition party came washington entourage aide chalabi went state department white house ask evidently successfully american funding main public event panel

chalabi life london charming suave middle aged man twinkle eye dressed double breasted pin striped suit striped shirt white spread collar although supporter argue iraqi national congress sufficient american support defeat saddam northern alliance defeated taliban afghanistan view people washington chalabi look part rebel military leader could fight last petit four tray tea savoy one skeptical former pentagon official told iraq also saddam military perhaps ten time size taliban quite successful putting revolt last decade united state left iraq believing saddam might soon fall internal rebellion chalabi supporter believe saddam much weaker even sign serious operation offing could finish non true believer seem coming around idea military operation saddam would mean deployment anywhere hundred thousand three hundred thousand american ground troop kenneth pollack former analyst national security council staff expert iraq last year clinton administration recently caused stir foreign policy world publishing article foreign affair calling war saddam noteworthy three year ago pollack two co author published article also foreign affair arguing iraqi national congress incapable defeating saddam pollack still think chalabi job belief would require substantial american ground air sea force closer size one used kuwait one using afghanistan pollack trim quick crisp

cornered competitor said matthew berk analyst jupiter research date stuff proprietary opening make accessible creative gifted programmer come wild stuff company never considered mr glaser said expected company produce technology would rival realnetworks commercially result community source strategy one possibility company sun could decide add helix technology realnetworks standard component operating system although realnetworks might get significant financial benefit arrangement could contribute making helix software de facto industry standard mr glaser said struck upon idea making medium server software open source visiting executive nokia world largest cellphone maker taking stuff beyond pc huge motivation u said realized nokia interested deploying software technology many

glaser said high glitz press conference san francisco announcing product lot technology breaking bottleneck making convergence really converge make new product compatible microsoft file however company pursued risky strategy known reverse engineering developer examine competitor product see work try create something work like glaser said engineer worked entirely clean room environment meaning access actual microsoft code simply copied code could liable patent infringement resulting product simply mimic way microsoft file sent across network allows window medium player receive file company sued simply copying competitor code putting product realnetworks say worried microsoft lawsuit took precaution development clean room environment microsoft engaged kind legal reverse

time talked two year ago beginning net era net evolution let start talking think xml revolution first talk net believe industry collectively decided last three four year world going replatformed xml key foundation like anyone ever got together decide like magnetic north clearly indicated everyone rallying around concept think degree xml pervasive might still underestimated lot partner even conference see big company really way software general designed way security work management everything changed answer direct question two year ago might said jury still whether xml going happen
